# Github Copilot Chats History

This repository stores chat histories and summaries generated from conversations with GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant.

## How to Save a Conversation Summary

**Prompt:**

Save a summary of this conversation in the repository NeoSelcev/Github-Copilot-Chats-History.
Create a new file named as follows:
`YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<platform>_<short-name>.md`
where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` is the current date and time (UTC),
- `<platform>` is the platform youâ€™re using (e.g., iOS, browser, VS Code, etc.),
- `<short-name>` is a brief identifier for this conversation (e.g., github-repo-setup).

The file content should be:
- The filename as the title (Markdown `#` heading)
- The platform and timestamp in a bullet list
- The short name as a subheading (Markdown `##`)
- The summary of the conversation below

Commit and push the file to the main branch with the message:
`Add conversation summary: <short-name> on <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS> (<platform>)`
